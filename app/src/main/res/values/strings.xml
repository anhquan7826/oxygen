    <string name="aqi_index_info">The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a daily reporting index that is considered a simplified measure of the level of air pollution. It indicates whether the air around us is clean or polluted and to what extent. The health risks to the community increase as the AQI value rises. The AQI focuses on the potential health effects that individuals may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.</string>
    <string name="no2_index_info">Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a compound composed of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, commonly found in soil and water. It is also known by other names such as Nitrite, Nitrogen Dioxide, or Nitrogen Dioxide Gas. NO2 gas has a reddish–brown color, has the ability to envelop urban areas, reducing human visibility. It is toxic, affecting both living organisms and the surrounding environment.\n\nAt various concentrations (measured in parts per million, ppm), NO2 can have different effects on the human body:\n– NO2 concentrations in the air reaching around 50–100 ppm can cause lung inflammation.\n– If the concentration reaches 150–200 ppm, it can lead to damage to the bronchial tubes and result in death if exposure is prolonged.\n– NO2 levels at 500 ppm or higher can cause death within 2–10 days.\n\nThese concentrations highlight the harmful impact of NO2 on human health and emphasize the importance of monitoring and controlling air quality to mitigate its adverse effects.</string>
    <string name="pm_index_info">PM is an abbreviation for Particulate Matter, which refers to particulate substances (solid or liquid). The number 2.5 represents the size of particles with a diameter smaller than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (µm), which is one millionth of a meter. Similarly, the designation PM10 refers to particles with a diameter smaller than or equal to 10 µm (but larger than the size of PM2.5).\n\nFine dust particles PM2.5 and PM10 enter the human body through the respiratory system when individuals breathe. Depending on the size of the dust particles, the degree of penetration varies. While PM10 particles enter the body through the airway and accumulate in the lungs, PM2.5 particles are more hazardous as they can penetrate into lung sacs, pulmonary veins, and infiltrate the bloodstream of individuals.\n\nWhen the concentration of PM2.5 fine dust in the outdoor air increases, it causes the air to become hazy, reducing visibility similar to fog. PM2.5 fine dust can easily penetrate the human body through the respiratory tract, causing various dangerous health conditions such as stroke, heart disease, and cancer. Individuals regularly exposed to fine dust may experience health issues such as sneezing, runny nose, difficulty breathing, and dry eyes. Prolonged exposure can increase the risk of reduced lung function, chronic bronchitis, and an increased likelihood of death from lung cancer and heart disease.</string>
